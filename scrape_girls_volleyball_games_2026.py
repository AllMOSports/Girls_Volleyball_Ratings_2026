MSHSAA Girls Volleyball GAMES Scraper - 2026 Season (schedule pull, no ratings)
=========================================================================

Adapted from scrape_football_games_2026.py, itself adapted from
girls_volleyball_ratings_2025.py (or whichever prior-season script exists for this sport -- adjust if the naming differs). Same request approach (requests + BeautifulSoup,
NOT Playwright -- the page is plain server-rendered HTML), same
session/retry logic, same data-school-ID based name-resolution -- MSHSAA's
scoreboard.aspx uses the same page template across sports, just a
different "alg" query-string code per sport (Girls Volleyball = alg=57
below). That template-reuse assumption is NOT verified against a live
Girls Volleyball scoreboard page from this environment (no network access to
mshsaa.org here) -- spot-check the first clean run's output against the
live site before trusting it for real use, same as you would for any new
scraper.

THIS IS A CLEAN, STRIPPED-DOWN FIRST RUN FOR GIRLS VOLLEYBALL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the football version, this script does NOT carry over football's
MANUAL_OVERRIDES (school-ID -> classification-name overrides) or its
accumulated manual_name_overrides.json corrections/exclusions/score
corrections -- those were built up specifically for football's roster and
would be wrong (or at best irrelevant) if applied here. Both mechanisms
start EMPTY for Girls Volleyball:
  - MANUAL_OVERRIDES (in build_id_to_classname) is an empty dict. Any school
    ID that doesn't cleanly match a name in classifications.json will show
    up unresolved -- that's the point of a clean run. Once you've seen
    which IDs come back unresolved, add Girls Volleyball-specific entries here,
    the same way football's list was built up.
  - MANUAL_OVERRIDES_PATH points to "girls_volleyball_manual_name_overrides.json",
    which almost certainly doesn't exist yet. load_manual_overrides() and
    load_score_corrections() already handle a missing file gracefully (0
    corrections/exclusions loaded, printed clearly) -- so this isn't a bug,
    it's the intended clean-run behavior. Create that file once you know
    what needs correcting, following the same schema as football's.

SCORE MODEL -- UNVERIFIED, NEEDS A LIVE SPOT-CHECK BEFORE TRUSTING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volleyball is played in a best-of-5 SET format, not a single running score
like football/soccer/softball. I don't know, without seeing a live MSHSAA
volleyball scoreboard page, whether td.score renders the MATCH result as
SETS WON (e.g. "3" vs "1") or something else (a set-by-set breakdown,
total points across all sets, etc.). MAX_POINTS below is set to 3 on the
assumption it's sets won -- this is a GUESS. Before trusting this script's
output, pull up a live girls volleyball scoreboard page for a completed
match and confirm what td.score actually contains, then fix MAX_POINTS
(and parse_score()'s validity range, if the shape is different than a
single small integer) to match. This mirrors the existing unverified-OT
caveat already in this file for the same reason -- I can't reach mshsaa.org
from this environment to check myself.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (same behavior as the football version)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. No "final" status requirement -- keeps scheduled/unscored games too.
  2. Detects team cells by scanning ALL cells in ALL rows for the
     data-school attribute / MySchool link, not a fixed row/column index.
  3. Score is optional -- captured if present and parseable, else null.
  4. No date.today() cap -- scrapes the full configured season range.
  5. Forfeited games are kept (with a "forfeit" boolean), not dropped.
  6. Overtime detection via row text match -- UNVERIFIED for this sport,
     same caveat as football's. Also worth checking: volleyball doesn't
     have "overtime" in the football sense at all (sets don't go to OT
     the same way a game does) -- confirm what, if anything, is_overtime()
     should even be matching for this sport, and strip the field out
     entirely if it's not a meaningful concept here.

REQUIRES (same as your existing pipeline, must be in the same directory
or update the paths below):
  - classifications.json  (Girls Volleyball 2026-27 projected classifications --
    NOTE: confirm this is Girls Volleyball's own classifications file and not
    football's; if AllMOSports keeps one shared classifications.json across
    all sports, filter this loader to this sport before using it, since
    class groupings differ per sport)
  - mshsaa_schools.csv     (school_id -> school_name lookup, shared across
    sports)

    Three passes over the >=0-classified game list, in order:
 
    1. Drop any game where NEITHER side resolved to a classifications.json
       team. These have no MSHSAA relevance at all (they come from some
       other section of the scoreboard page, not an actual Missouri
       school's game) and this rule keeps catching new ones automatically
       every week with no maintenance -- this is the fix for the "at
       least one side must be classified" requirement.
    2. Drop anything in the manual exclusion list (matched on the exact
       raw date/team1/team2 as scraped -- these are specific one-off bad
       or duplicate games that don't fit a general rule).
    3. Apply a manual correction to the unclassified side's name, if one
       is on file for (date, classified side's name). Applied
       unconditionally when matched -- if MSHSAA's site later fills in
       its own name for that slot, this will still overwrite it with the
       name you confirmed, which is the point (holds true across score
       updates by design). If that's ever NOT what you want for a given
