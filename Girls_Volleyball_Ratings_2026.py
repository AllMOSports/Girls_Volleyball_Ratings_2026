"""
MSHSAA Girls Volleyball 2026 -- games, schedule, and ratings in one run
=============================================================================
Consolidates what used to be three separate scripts:
  1. scrape_girls_volleyball_games_2026.py     -> games JSON/CSV (strict + _all)
  2. build_girls_volleyball_schedule_2026.py   -> per-team schedule JSON/CSV
  3. Girls_Volleyball_Ratings_2026.py          -> ratings JSON/CSV, rankings CSVs
 
One scrape of the MSHSAA scoreboard covers everything: every date from
SEASON_START through SEASON_END (no stop at today), so upcoming games land
in the schedule files too. The ratings only use completed games from that
same scrape -- both teams classified, both scores posted, marked Final,
not a forfeit.
 
REQUIRES (same directory):
  - classifications.json   (Girls Volleyball's own)
  - mshsaa_schools.csv
  - girls_volleyball_manual_name_overrides.json   (optional -- schedule name
    corrections/exclusions/score fills; skipped if missing)

#      the current rating gap, instead of an all-or-nothing 40-point cutoff.

#      signal, instead of letting a tiny sample fully drive their rating.
#   3. MOV_CAP bounds how much error any single game -- even a fully-weighted
#      one -- can contribute, so no one result can swing a rating too hard.
